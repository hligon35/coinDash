# Coin Dash

## Overview

Coin Dash is a fast-paced arcade game where the objective is to collect as many coins as possible while avoiding obstacles and racing against the clock. As you progress, the game gets more challenging with more obstacles and exciting power-ups!

## How to Play

1.  **Start the Game**: Click or tap the "Start Game" button on the main screen or when the game is over.
2.  **Control the Player**: 
    - On desktop: Use the arrow keys (or configured input) to move your character around the screen.
    - On touch devices: There are two ways to control the player:
        - **Touch Joystick**: Touch and drag anywhere on the screen to create a virtual joystick that controls the character's movement.
        - **Direct Touch**: Tap anywhere on the screen and the character will move toward that position.
3.  **Collect Coins**: Move your character over the spinning coins to collect them. Each coin increases your score.
4.  **Grab Power-ups**: Occasionally, a power-up will appear. Collect it to gain benefits like extra points and bonus time.
5.  **Avoid Cacti**: Cacti will appear on the screen. Touching a cactus will end the game.
6.  **Watch the Timer**: You have a limited amount of time to collect coins. When the timer reaches zero, the game is over.
7.  **Level Up**: Collect all coins on the screen to advance to the next level. Each new level increases the difficulty and adds more coins. You also get a small time bonus for leveling up.
